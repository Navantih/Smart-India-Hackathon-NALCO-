The code applies regression and clustering on alloy data. Linear regression predicts tensile strength with preprocessing and reveals key features. DBSCAN explores hidden structures: first on two features to detect clusters/outliers, then on five alloy elements with 2D/3D/parallel plots, correlations, and cluster characteristics.
